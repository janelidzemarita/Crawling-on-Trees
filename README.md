# Crawling-on-Trees

Crawling on Trees
Once again, consider binary trees, which we define as:

type tree = Empty | Node of int * tree * tree
In this assignment you are supposed to implement a crawler that walks along binary trees and performs different operations. At any time, the crawler “sits” on a particular node of the tree (this includes the Empty-leaf). In the following we refer to this node as the current node. Furthermore, the crawler uses a stack to store trees. Initially, the crawler is positioned at the input tree’s root and is then instructed using the commands

type command = Left | Right | Up | New of int | Delete | Push | Pop
with the following meaning:

Left moves the crawler to the current node’s left child.

Right moves the crawler to the current node’s right child.

Up moves the crawler up to the current node’s parent node.

New x replaces the current node (including all children) with a new node with value x.

Delete removes the current node (including all children) leaving behind an Empty- leaf.

Push pushes the subtree rooted at the current node onto the stack. The tree stays unchanged.

Pop replaces the subtree rooted at the current node with the topmost tree of the stack. The tree is then popped from the stack.


Implement a function crawl : command list -> tree -> tree that executes a list of crawler commands on the given tree.

You may assume that the list of commands is always valid, so there is no Left or Right when the crawler is already at a leaf, no Up when it is on the root and no Pop when the stack is empty.

Hint: The tricky part is to get the Up command right. If you do not manage to implement this correctly, leave it out and you will still get some points if the rest is correct.
